## Description

Set in a small dark apartment, you look around only to find a TV playing a meteorological warning. The apartment looks haphazard, furniture pieces are astray, boxes of food left here and there. Spilled glasses of wine, pills, is everything OK? As you inspect the apartment, you notice the television saying something about not looking out... but do you have a choice?

### Concept 

The entire project is inspired from an analog-horror channel on Youtube, Local58. I used a video of theirs called [Weather Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75VLQuFPrY) as the main focal and plot point of the environment. The environment in a sense can be thought of as an extension of the video's universe, further immersing the user into the experience of hearing a distorted weather warning.

The apartment was conceptualized off a Brooklyn apartment, and I started by drawing the layout of the apartment and design it in a way that is livable in real life. Then, I started partitioning and dividing the space into different parts, a kitchen, a living area, a toilet, a bedroom, before furnishing it. After designing a proper apartment, I then began to decompose it, breaking down the symmetry and tidiness of the place to give it the impression of a messy look.

### Reflection

There were certain elements that I wished I could've done better, but given the time constraints I was rather happy with the final output of my project. I wanted the moonlight to completely fill the apartment as the blinds opened, but I wasn't able to get realtime lighting to bounce. Adding the animations were also rather challenging for me, as I struggled to access the objects in the script and it was only after much trial and error I was able to get them working. 

I also want to get better at making my own assets, although I know that they'll be a huge time sink. Whenever I was not able to find a 3rd-party asset for an element I wanted to add, I had to heavily debate with myself whether it was worth spending half to an hour to add one tiny object as I wasn't that comfortable with ProBuilder. Most of the time, I just scrapped the idea entirely and used alternative 3rd-party assets.

I'm very happy with the lighting for the apartment, and it gave off the vibe and impression I wanted. It looks lit, but at the same time gloomy, and I was really proud of the light sources I had as they feel realistic. 

I've always loved atmospheric horror games, especially PS1-styled horror games, or something like [World of Horror](https://store.steampowered.com/app/913740/WORLD_OF_HORROR/) which feels like there is something greater than our human brains can understand. I'm glad I'm finally able to create something my project to this space, and I might continue making atmospheric horror environments for the rest of my projects, though I feel like it might be a good idea to branch out.
